1) First you need to open command promt from the file directory.

2) run this command:   pip install -r imports.txt
If the command doesnt work see if you have any fualty text inside imports.txt Or any typos in your command

3) Once done, run mainfile.txt

If that doesn't work, please go on my discord server and ask me whats the problem.
